# Binance-BTC-Data-Analysis

This project demonstrates how to link a Binance account API to Python for fetching and analyzing Bitcoin (BTC) data. The project includes steps for setting up the Binance client, fetching ticker data, market depth, historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, preprocessing the data, and visualizing it using `mplfinance`.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install python-binance pandas mplfinance
